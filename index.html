            Using computer science to improve accessability is something I'm passionate about related to social good.
            For example, in high school, with my robotics team, I developed a device that identifies objects
            for the visually impaired, which became a global finalist for the First Robotics Competition.
            To make our product viable and useful, we partnered with the National Federation for the Blind to tailor the
            product for our clients by integrating their feedback.
